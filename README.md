# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Record

This repository is a collection of DSA implementations and solutions for Leetcode problems. The main DS that will be covered here are the following:
- Array
- Hash
- Min/Max Heap
- Graphs
- Trees

## Patterns
Many of the DSA problems can be solved in optimal time/space complexity with the help of some patterns. These patterns can be categorized based on the data structured used by the problem.

### Array
- Two Pointer
- Fixed Sliding Window
- Dynamic Sliding Window

### Hash Map
- Count exact constraint
